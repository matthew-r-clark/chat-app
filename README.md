# Chat App

Very simple chat app to practice using React and socket.io.

- Chat history is only maintained in current window.
- Each new window will be treated as a separate user.
- Can chat in "General" room with everyone or private chat one-on-one.
- User typing statuses are shown in each room.
- Messages received on unselected rooms will trigger a badge alert with the number of unseen messages.
